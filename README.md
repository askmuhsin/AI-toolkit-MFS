# Al-toolkit-MFS
A set of optimization functions and pipelines build from basics, for Neural Nets, Evolutionary Algorithms and Swarm Intelligence.

## There will be four sections in this git. 
<ol>
<li>Neural Networks<li>
<li>Evolutionary Algorithms<li>
<li>Swarm Intelligence<li>
<li>General<li>
<ol>
  
The first Three sections will have codes written exclusively pertaining to the respective topics.
Fourth section will cover mainly :
  General math functions (related to linear algebra, ode, ...)
  Some common optimization problems.
  
The codes will be written in MATLAB, Python, and C++.

Note : The purpose of this repository is to provide fundemantal understanding of AI. There are several well documented libraries
and frameworks out there covering almost all the codes written here. The idea here is to assist someone who is just starting 
out to get a deeper knowledge of the process involved.
