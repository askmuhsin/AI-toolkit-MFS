<h1>Al-toolkit-MFS</h1>
<p>A set of optimization functions and pipelines build from basics, for Neural Nets, Evolutionary Algorithms and Swarm Intelligence.</p>

## There will be four sections in this git. 
<ol>
<li>Neural Networks</li>
<li>Evolutionary Algorithms</li>
<li>Swarm Intelligence</li>
<li>General</li>
</ol>

<p>The first Three sections will have codes written exclusively pertaining to the respective topics.
Fourth section will cover mainly general math functions (related to linear algebra, ode, ...) and some common optimization problems.</p>
  
<p>Eventually the idea is to write the code in C++, Python and Matlab. 
To start with either one of the languages will be used.</p>
 
<p>Note : There are several well documented libraries and frameworks out there for AI and optimization related problems.
For example the neural network toolbox in MATLAB, or scikit in Python. 
The idea here is by no means to provide a replacement. This repo is aimed to assist someone who is just starting 
out to have a closer look at the operations under the hood, ie.. is to have a properly annotated set of codes for individual algorithms commonly used, while keeping things at a low level (ie.. by using minimal amount of libraries or dependencies).
